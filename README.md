# DMTA_Project_2022Fall
Outliers detection and Cluster algorithms comparisons. 

This is the project detail in the course Data Mining Theory and Application taught by Yunfeng Wu in Xiamen University in 2022Fall. It is worth noting that the project for this course was my first exposure to python programming and programming reports writing. As a result, there are some obvious deficiencies like embarrassing abstract in the final report. However, I would like to upload this project as a record of my growth and progress, which could remind me that I stay modest and hungry.

The project was divided into 2 parts lay in midterm and final. The target of midterm part was to detect outliers in data by Nair and Grubbs, while the final part required conducting K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm step by step, in which I also tried other 10 Clustering algorithms through python packages.
