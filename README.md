# DMTA_2022Fall
Outliers detection and Cluster algorithms comparisons. This is the project detail in the course Data Mining Theory and Application taught by Yunfeng Wu in Xiamen University in 2022Fall. It is worth noting that the project for this course was my first exposure to python programming and programming reports writing. As a result, there are some glaring deficiencies like embarrassing abstract in the final report. However, I would like to upload this project as a record of my growth and progress, which could remind me that I stay modest and hungry.
